## honors project work

This repo will the home of working documents for my honors project!!

## git workflow
1. open issues for major coding components
2. work on those issues on a corresponding branch (ie, issue_1)
3. pull request/merge to master when that step is finished

This way, I have a log of what I did and when. 

## best practices/reminders

Mostly to remind myself as I go to be neat for future Raven

* Name files so that they are human & machine readable
* Try to be consistent in naming conventions for files, objects, etc 
    + underscores between "parts" of file names (ie McKnight_draft)
    + dashes within parts (ie McKnight_draft-one)
    + dashes in script names
    + underscores in var/object names
    + camelCase for functions? if I write those?
    + ___use dates instead of "version 1", "version 2" etc (especially for data exported by scripts)___
* Be consistent with what you call data across documents (learn from internship mistakes)
* If comparing data across time, make sure years are indicated in column names (learn from internship mistakes part 2) (ex: EMP2010 and EMP2016)
* For scripts especially, include a description at the top of inputs/outputs and what the file does (and if things need to be run in a specific order, number them appropriately)
* Define abbreviations you're going to use a lot (bgs, sc, etc)
* Try to make sure each file exists for a reason
* Ensure that someone else could clone and run (include images, `install.packages()`, etc)
* In general, follow internship style guide?
* Use branches/PRs if necessary but don't over-complicate
* ___document document document!!!___
